A React-based cricket team management website where users can select players, manage coins, and build their dream cricket team.

## Technologies Used

2. **Dynamic Coin System**: Earn coins through interactions and use them to add players.
3. **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for selecting, viewing, and removing players.
